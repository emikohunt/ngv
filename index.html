				<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
				<p>I have been working in marketing and communications for over five years.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I started out in book publishing and editing, but my passion forged ahead with developing technologies and I've gained skills and developed a keen interest in the digital sphere.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I have a knack for social media, blogs, content creation, digital production, website and CRM management as well as copywriting and editing. I'm also a great project manager – from digital projects to events or website redesigns.</p>
				</br>
				<p>I get a serious satisfaction from ticking off a to-do list, I love anything digital and I love learning – I'm currently taking a night course in front-end web development.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Outside of work, I love to read, cook (and eat) Japanese food, exercise, go to gigs and exhibitions and I'm a keen traveller. I enjoy the outdoors, sunshine, learning new things and I am a huge animal lover – show me a dog wearing a bandana I'm all smiles.</p>

				<h2>KEY SELECTION CRITERIA</h2>
				<a name="ksc"></a>
				<br>
				<h4>1. Relevant tertiary degree and practical experience</h4>
				<p>I currently work for Australian College of the Arts, where I manage the marketing and communications for the college. This involves working to develop the college’s digital marketing strategy – from improving our website to managing online communities through our social media channels.</p>
				<p>As well as the qualifications mentioned above, I have over five years’ experience in marketing and communications in these roles:</p>
				<p>> Marketing Communications Coordinator, Australian College of the Arts</p>
				<p>> Communications Coordinator, YMCA Victoria</p>
				<p>> Editorial Assistant, Ilura Press</p>
				<p>> Digital Marketing and Communications Consultant, Freelance</p>
				<br>
				<h4>2. Creativity and innovation</h4>
				<p>I currently work in a highly-creative work environment where originality and innovation is encouraged. Even though I have been working at the college for nearly three years, we never do things in the same way. For example, I am currently managing the creation of new marketing collateral, where we are working with new graphic designers who will collaborate with artists to create exciting marketing materials. I also run events and workshops at the college – from daytime DJ workshops to sit-down, folk-inspired songwriting workshops with some of Melbourne’s best musicians.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>3. Detail focus</h4>
				<p>I am the type of person who takes a lot of pride in their work and will do all that it takes to deliver high-quality outcomes. When I see problems or possibilities for improvement, my response is to address issues and look for solutions or better outcomes. I am always encouraging of new ideas and creative approaches and I believe that collaboration and brainstorming with others is a great way to come up with ideas you may not come to on your own. I am a stickler for detail, am very organised and I love a check-off list!</p>
				<br>
				<h4>4. Communication</h4>
				<p>I have extensive experience managing communication activities. In my previous role at YMCA Victoria I managed e-newsletter strategies, the e-communications platform and social media channels. At my current place of work I manage the e-communications strategy and platform, I manage the website, I manage the company’s social media channels and I write, edit and publish articles for various publications.</p>
				<p>I also hold a Graduate Diploma in Editing and Publishing, so have a strong command of the English language. I understand that communication needs to be shaped and cultivated to suit audiences and am adept with writing audience profiles and writing copy for these audiences.</p>
				<p>I am experienced with writing for a range of mediums and formats, am comfortable writing in different styles and am confident using a variety of communication channels.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>5. Drive and commitment</h4>
				<p>I think the fact that I have been at my current role for nearly three years is demonstrative of my drive and commitment. When I first began at Australian College of the Arts, the business was still in a start-up phase. Over the last few years the college has grown from strength to strength. We have had a large increase in student numbers, an increase in staff, increased reach and increased brand recognition.</p>
				<p>Another more personal demonstration of my drive to achieve goals is my continued study while working full time. I like to learn and continually develop my skill set, so I am currently undertaking a night course in front-end web development. As part of this, I am building my own website (I undertake freelance marketing consulting) and I’m really proud of the new skills I’m acquiring! I like to keep busy and I like to work hard and achieve.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>6. Environmental scanning</h4>
				<p>I definitely like open communication and work with the belief that it’s better to ask people who have expertise and insight rather than trying to do everything yourself. Co-workers and networks are a great resource and I try to establish a strong network of people around me. I also enjoy keeping an eye on trends and remaining current. The digital space is progressive and moving at such a fast speed that in order to remain relevant and skilled, it’s necessary to know what is happening in the market, but also to have the foresight to strategise and adapt.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>7.Relationship building and teamwork</h4>
				<p>My current role requires me to work with a variety of stakeholders, including: members of the academic board, senior-level management, students, teaching and administrative staff, schools and training institutions, organisations that we have partnerships with and our prospective students. I am very friendly and respectful and I am confident that coworkers would say they trust me and enjoy working with me. I have an open communication style and am very collaborative as a person.</p>
				<p>Outside of my job I work in a very similar way. I have a network of people in the marketing industry and we often attend seminars together, or get together to swap skills and assist with each other’s projects.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>8. Organising and planning</h4>
				<p>In my current role at Australian College of the Arts I research, conceptualise, project manage and review various marketing campaigns. For example I have managed brand campaigns that involve researching and mapping out target audiences and writing audience profiles. These campaigns have also involved researching and connecting with those in the industry who we would like to associate and align our organisation with, and researching how to leverage off other brands and organisations. The campaigns have involved social media, various advertising channels, collaboration with other brands, sponsorship of industry-related events, creation of merchandise, editorial and publicity. It has also involved working with and leveraging off our internal human resources (staff and students) who already have a strong connection with the brand. In order to succeed in managing these campaigns and projects, I have had to identity processes, tasks and resources, and then review and adjust to make sure goals are achieved.</p>
